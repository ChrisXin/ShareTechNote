# Android_Map_Application


SensorReading.Java
This Android application reads the various sensors available on the phone and graphs them. The code initializes an Android Activity; accept the values from the phone’s sensors; and display these values on the screen.

StepCounter.Java
This interprets sensor data. I created a pedometer application for Android phone. This application will read the phone’s accelerometer to count the user’s steps. I try to make the pedometer as accurate as possible.
