### 2 key ingredients

1. Optimal substrcture 

2. Overlapping subproblems


### memoization
To avoid calculating values multiple times, store intermediate calculations in a Hash table/Array.

We save (memoize) computed answers for possible later reuse, rather than re-computing the answer multiple times

### Top-down Approach

From the very top, we break the problem into sub-problems

### bottom-up Approach

Solve smaller problems and use these to build a solution for the problem
